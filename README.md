# Monash Coding League Season 2 - Debugging challenge problem 2 (Merged sorted lists)

## How do I attempt this problem?

1. Create a personal copy of this repository.
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request to this repository when instructed.

## File descriptions

- `merge_sorted_lists.py` - main program logic.
- `demo.py` - demo.
- `test_merged_sorted_lists.py` - unit tests for main program logic.
- `linked_list.py` - linked list class and associated functions.

## Constraints / guarantees

1. There is **at least** one bug present in the main program logic.
2. No changes can be made to `demo.py`.

## What constitutes a bug?

A bug is anything that causes the program to give an incorrect result or
unexpected **behaviour**.

`demo.py` should provide an example of how the program is expected to be used.

## What should a submission contain?

An ideal submission should contain:

- Tests that correctly identify each bug.
- Changes to main program logic that correctly addresses the root cause of
    each bug.
- The overall algorithm of the main program logic should not be changed. e.g.
  Don't convert the binary search to a linear search.

## How are submissions assessed?

For each bug identified:

- 1 point is awarded if there is a unit test that correctly isolates it and a
  fix.
- 0.5 point is awarded if there is just a fix.
