# Monash Coding League Season 2 - Debugging challenge problem 2 (Merged sorted lists)

## How do I attempt this problem?

1. Download a copy of this repository.
2. Study the behaviour of the code. Don't be afraid to experiment!
3. Identify a bug.
4. Describe what the bug is and a possible fix (even better if there's an actual
   code fix).

## What does an ideal solution look like?

An ideal solution:

1. Contains a test case that isolates the bug.
2. A description of the root cause of the bug.
    - In other words, changing the existing unit tests and demo code to get
      'correct' behaviour is unlikely to be an actual fix. Often times, in
      production code, changing client code is not feasible.
3. A description (or code) of a fix that addresses the root cause.

## Submissions

Submission details will be announced on the commencement of the challenge.

## File descriptions

- `merge_sorted_lists.py` - main program logic.
- `demo.py` - demo.
- `test_merged_sorted_lists.py` - unit tests for main program logic.
- `linked_list.py` - linked list class and associated functions.

## Constraints / guarantees

1. There is **at least** one bug present in the main program logic.
2. No changes can be made to `demo.py`.

## What constitutes a bug?

A bug is anything that causes the program to give an incorrect result or
unexpected **behaviour**.

`demo.py` should provide an example of how the program is expected to be used.
